                                            - Finished API docs

                                            - Started implementing the documentation via perlpod
                                            - Implemented command line options:
                                              [--version] [--help] [-h] [-?] [--man] [--changelog]

                                            Round Cube DB:
                                            - Fixed bug that not set value for 'email', 'name', 'firstname' or 'surname' 
                                              column causes SQL errors. 'email', 'name', 'firstname' will never be NULL
                                              due to the implementation. But 'surname' might.
                                            - Checking $userId, $changed and $sth as well
                                            - Don't let the whole script fail if $userId or $sth is NULL. Only roll back 
                                              the Round Cube DB transaction!

                                            - Lazy Update implemented
                                            - Implemented dedicated EGW user lists FBOX_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS, RCUBE_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS, MUTT_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS
                                              in addition to already existing global EGW user list EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS

                                            RoundCube:
                                            - It turned out that the current state of the implementation already 
                                              supports global address books in Round Cube. Successfully tested!
                                            - You need to install the Round Cube plug in 'globaladdressbook' first.

                                            - Moving hard coded variables from cronjob.sh to egw2fbox.conf:
                                               * CRON_FBOX_XML_HASH, CRON_FBOX_UPLOAD_SCRIPT
                                            - Added comment awareness of config file parser in cronjob.sh

                                            Update clients only if EGW contacts changed for defined EGW user:
                                            - Preparation of egw2fbox.conf for lazy update feature:

                                            Allow defining a different EGW user list for each client:
                                            - Preparation of egw2fbox.conf for defining different EGW address book owners per each client
                                               * FBOX_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS, RCUBE_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS, MUTT_EGW_ADDRBOOK_OWNERS

                                            - Removing need for $egw_address_data being an global variable to be able to 
                                              sync different user / group address books for different clients
                                            - Making egw_read_db() flexible to return addresses for different address book owners
                                            - Caching EGW addresses to avoid DB access
                                            - egw_read_db() now retuning last modified time stamp to stop writing data to external
                                              client if not modified since last run, if MAIN calling export routine supports this

                                            - implemented SQL part of round cube address book sync but
                                              still check field size before inserting into DB needs tbd

                                            - started implementing round cube address book sync because I feel it is urgent ;-)
                                              did not touch any SQL code, need to update all TO DOs with inserting SQL code
                                            - remove need for $FRITZXML being a global variable

                                            - tidy up code to fulfill Perl::Critic tests at "gentle" severity:

                                            - data is requested from DB in UTF8 and explicitly converted in desired encoding
                                              inside of fbox_write_xml_contact function
                                            - mutt export function now writes aliases file in UTF-8 now. If you use anything
                                              different - you're wrong!
                                            - fixed bug: for private contact entries in FritzBox the home number was taken from
                                              database field tel_work instead of tel_home
                                            - extended fbox_reformatTelNr to support local phone number annotation to work around
                                              inability of FritzBox to rewrite phone number for incoming calls

                                            - added support for mutt address book including an example file showing 
                                              how to configure ~/.muttrc to support a local address book and a global
                                              EGW address book
                                            - replaced time stamp in fritz box xml with real time stamp from database
                                              this feature is more interesting for round cube integration where we have
                                              a time stamp field in the round cube database
                                            - added some comments

                                            - Verbose function:
                                               * only prints if data was provided
                                               * avoiding unnecessary verbose function calls
                                               * avoiding runtime errors due to uninitialized data in verbose mode
                                            - Respect that Fritzbox address book names can only have 25 characters
                                            - EGW address book to Fritz Box phone book mapping:
                                              The Fritz Box Phone book knows 3 different telephone number types:
                                                'work', 'home' and 'mobile'
                                              Each Fritz Box phone book entry can have up to 3 phone numbers.
                                              All 1-3 phone numbers can be of same type or different types.
                                              * Compact mode (if one EGW address has 1-3 phone numbers):
                                                 EGW field tel_work          -> FritzBox field type 'work'
                                                 EGW field tel_cell          -> FritzBox field type 'mobile'
                                                 EGW field tel_assistent     -> FritzBox field type 'work'
                                                 EGW field tel_home          -> FritzBox field type 'home'
                                                 EGW field tel_cell_private  -> FritzBox field type 'mobile'
                                                 EGW field tel_other         -> FritzBox field type 'home'
                                                NOTE: Because we only have 3 phone numbers, we stick on the right number types.
                                              * Business Fritz Box phone book entry (>3 phone numbers):
                                                 EGW field tel_work          -> FritzBox field type 'work'
                                                 EGW field tel_cell          -> FritzBox field type 'mobile'
                                                 EGW field tel_assistent     -> FritzBox field type 'home'
                                                NOTE: On hand sets, the list order is work, mobile, home. That's why the
                                                      most important number is 'work' and the less important is 'home' here.
                                              * Private Fritz Box phone book entry (>3 phone numbers):
                                                 EGW field tel_home          -> FritzBox field type 'work'
                                                 EGW field tel_cell_private  -> FritzBox field type 'mobile'
                                                 EGW field tel_other         -> FritzBox field type 'home'
                                                NOTE: On hand sets, the list order is work, mobile, home. That's why the
                                                      most important number is 'work' and the less important is 'home' here.
                                             - Added EGW DB connect string check
                                             - All EGW functions have now prefix 'egw_', all Fritz Box functions prefix
                                               'fbox_' and all Round Cube functions 'rcube_' to prepare the source for
                                               adding the round cube sync.
